"Hi doctor, I am a 19 year old woman. I have always had normal 28 day cycle. Before five months, I have stopped taking a low dose hormonal birth control pill in favor of the paragard IUD. My cycle continued as normal after this. However, before two months, I had periods after 21 days and the next month too the same 21 day cycle followed. Then, I began my cycle after 14 days and have been menstruating for 15 days now. Other confounding variables include moving to the college, which were a large climate, altitude and environmental change as well as resuming sexual activity around the beginning of this cycle. I was tested for STIs before five months and received negative results. I have remained in a monogamous relationship. What is your opinion? Do I need to visit my gynecologist? I have heard that hormone pills can be taken to stop bleeding. Is that true?","Q. After IUD insertion, my cycle has become irregular. What is your opinion?",Low Risk

"Hello doctor, I have been trying to conceive since 9/11/2014, which is when I stopped birth control pills and started prenatal vitamins. My cycles before BCP (Birth Control Pills) were always regular, about 30 days +/- 1 day with a 7 day period. And on BCP, my cycles were always 28 days, with a 5 day period. When I stopped BCP, I had a 5 day period, which began my first cycle of 31 days. The next cycle began with a 6 day period and the cycle lasted 37 days. Then this current cycle, which began with a four day period, a bit lighter than normal. I am currently on CD 27 and I believe I ovulated 3-4 days ago. So, the problem here is that I start spotting on CD 25, along with light cramping. It was only a very little bit of light brown blood, so I did not think much of it. Yesterday, CD 26, I had a little more throughout the day, then quite a bit right before bed. This morning, I am still spotting but much heavier than the past two days, and am starting to get a little alarmed by this. The blood is still brown. Any ideas on why this is happening, presumably 3-4 days past ovulation? Is this cause for concern? I have never spotted ever before. Also, I started taking Vitex at the beginning of this cycle in hopes of shortening my cycle a bit. Thank you in advance for any advice.",Q. I have been trying to conceive.

"Hi doctor,I have had migraines all of my life as long as I can remember. A year ago, I suddenly fainted, hit my head on the wall and received a concussion. Right before I fainted, I was feeling like I had to burp and I had lots of saliva in my mouth. My head was hurting and I felt dizzy. Then, I felt nauseous and was gagging like I had to throw up, But, I did not. I ran to the bathroom and the nauseous feeling went away, but I fainted and was passed out for a little over a minute, from what my friend said. Then, I heard them yell my name and I slowly woke up confused. I felt fine afterwards. I went to the doctor the next day and they said I had a concussion syndrome. But, the other symptoms were red flags and so I was referred to a neurologist. After three months of tests, as my MRI came out fine without any tumors or anything of the sort, and had two EEGs, he had diagnosed me with one type of potential seizure activity while asleep and another type in another area while awake. My first question is, is that possible?Also, the medicines prescribed earlier for migraine did no good for my daily pounding headaches, dizziness and faint spells. I only had two to three other episodes after that where I would randomly faint. Those were around 5 and 7 months ago.

"Hello doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman. I am suffering from severe anemia (iron and B12 deficiency). This might be the result of prolonged malnutrition over the past few years. The problem is that I have developed extreme sensitivity to most of the drugs, medication, treatment. In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea. About five years ago, upon the doctor’s advice and supervision, I was fed intravenously through saline bottle with some Iron injection to it. Immediately in about 15 minutes after the procedure, I experienced shortness of breath, burning sensation in muscles, swelling of legs, fatigue, and diarrhea. It subsided when I was given an antidote by the doctor immediately. From then onwards I was reluctant to take any of my medicines and undergo any treatment. I just focussed on improving my diet. Recently upon doctor’s advice, I took some medical tests and the reports were serum ferritin: 3.0 ng/mL, vitamin B12: 129 pg/mL, TSH: 0.02 µIU/mL (but T3/T4 tests are fine), iron: 15 µg/dL, TIBC: 527 µg/dL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, vitamin D: 18.39 ng/mL. I was also informed that I developed food allergy to some foods. Lately, I am experiencing a headache with activity, unexplained generalized weakness, fatigue most of the time.

"Hello doctor, Three weeks ago, I had headache in late night. I managed to sleep, but it was still there in the morning. It was unilateral headache on the left side of my head. Pain is in my temporal area which sometimes radiates across my cheek and even down my jaw, as well as on the top left of my head. I have occasionally felt discomfort on my chin too, almost like a bruised bone feeling when pressed. The pain subsided with Paracetamol and Ibuprofen, but returned the following evening. Medication no longer had any effect on it. After a week of non-stop pain, I went to my doctor. He could not work out why I was having the pain when I have absolutely no other symptoms. I feel fine other than the pain. He sent me to other hospital for further evaluation. My bloods were taken and came back normal and I passed all of the doctor's strength, reflex and cognitive tests. It was a mystery to him too. He referred me to a specialist who said it was likely a benign tension headache and I was discharged. While the pain is not generally as bad as it was, it is still there every day. I get a few moments of pain every now and then, as well as head pressure. But, some days the pain lasts all day, a dull ache that does not seem to shift. The most annoying part of is that within a minute of my head hitting the pillow at night severe pain suddenly kicks in my left temporal region and back of the head. I could not sleep without taking medication. At home, I have tried three different pillows, yet I still get pain. The only medication I take for it is a combination of Paracetamol and Aspirin. I am currently taking it each night about 30 minutes before bed to ensure the pain will not kick in. If I do not do this I simply cannot sleep. I do not want to be reliant on these pills or take too many, so I am trying to limit myself to just two of each before bed. I still have no other symptoms other than the unilateral pain and pressure. I do not suffer with migraines and do not feel anxious or stressed at the moment. The only anxiety I have recently felt was during hospital visits as my pulse rate went a little high, but returned to normal later. Is it really a tension headache or something else?

"Hello doctor, More than 20 years ago, I suffered from anxiety derived from the use of drugs and my family situation, from which I recovered with Deanxit and psychoanalytic therapy. Of course, I quitted cocaine forever. I was in therapy for seven years. At the end I recovered completely, having a full and happy life for more than 10 years. I have a great wife and daughter and very good friends and have a good relation with my family. The fact is that I was feeling very well until about two years ago I began to experiment as if I could not enjoy things. A few months later, being quiet at home at night, an incredible and strong chemical depletion suddenly came over me. It was like a feeling of chemical depletion of the neurotransmitters or something like that in the brain that caused me a downturn similar to when you use drugs. Like when you have a sudden drop of blood pressure. It was not the depression of being crying, feeling of worthlessness, deep sadness. It was these desperate and unbearable feeling. This lasted about 3 days, so I went to my psychiatrist because I could not take that feeling of intense downturn anymore (I have to say that years ago I had already felt those feelings for short periods of time, like a few minutes, and then disappeared, but I did not give them much more importance). He prescribed me Deanxit again two times a day and after four days I was fine. The fact is that he withdrew it a month and the next day I noticed again the unbearable symptoms of the beginning. I went back to the medication and felt good again, but I wanted to switch to a stronger one, following my psychiatrist's advice, because sometimes I was still feeling bad. I tried many others that did not work or made me feel worse. I have tried in between other therapies such as cognitive-behavioral, EMDR, acupuncture and I believe that none comes to the heart of the matter, that it is a serious chemical imbalance that is happening to me and that I cannot overcome and balance. I have also performed neurofeedback, as well as resonance of the head requested by a neurologist and they saw nothing. I am a person who is not obsessed at all with things, very cautious in life and have a successful business for years. I do not usually stress except on some occasions and I consider myself quite rational in general, so I cannot understand why this is happening to me, I am looking for someone who can diagnose my disease, beyond the generic term of depression and anxiety, in which, because of the symptoms that I have explained, I am not reflected. I think that the dysphoria would be the closest, but I also do not feel that irritability that accompanies it. Have you met a patient with similar symptoms before? Or maybe someone to whom you can refer me to understand what is happening here? I absolutely trust science, and I just want to return to the state of normality that I had before all these crises that, I repeat, are so intense and unbearable that I want to die when I suffer them, and that I need to understand what happens to me, having more opinions from other experts.",Q.

"Hi doctor, Five days ago (for the first time in my life) I went to the emergency room of the local hospital. I had awakened at 3 AM with severe dizziness and nausea.

"Hello doctor, My symptoms started a few months back. The symptoms are mostly neurological, eyesight, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and nausea. I am currently taking 500 mg Depakote ER and 150 mg Lamictal ER daily for seizures and have been taking them for several years now. My questions are not related to my medications necessarily. I am wondering if it is possible for the body to absorb heavy metals like lead, thallium, mercury and cadmium for example from new body piercings, specifically earlobe piercing, if the needle or jewelry is dirty or has toxic metals in them. I have been chronically exposed to puncture wounds with needles that could potentially have toxic metals in them for many months and I am worried that I may be poisoned. What should I do? More details about the presenting complaint: The symptoms were sudden and stronger originally than they are currently but I still have symptoms. The symptoms started a few months back. I had several puncture wounds before that. Previous history of the same issue: I have never experienced these symptoms before. Current medications: Depakote and Lamictal. Past medications of the same issue: I have been taking Depakote and Lamictal for several years.
